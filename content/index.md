Hey! Cool that you are here. This is my Digital Garden. This is not a blog, but rather a collection of my ideas and knowledge that I think are valuable. Don't expect complete or perfectly written articles. Instead, the text here will improve gradually over time.

The topics here are all about my profession as a software engineer, my hobbies and the life in Austria. Btw. I'm from there, so most of the notes are written in my native language, German, except for the software engineering topics.
